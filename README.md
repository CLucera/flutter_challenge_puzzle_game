Flutter puzzle challenge 

## Getting Started

Clone this repo and run `flutter run -d chrome` this is still an incoplete sample for the puzzle challenge using only Implicit animations to obtain the result

you can see an interactive sample on http://puzzle.hatdroid.com/

Consider this project to be extremely incomplete and just experimenting with Animations, you can find all the used code inside game_screen.dart (It is a bad practice to put all the code in a single file but it is just some experiment.)
